# Water Reminder Plugin for Stream Deck

## Overview
**Water Reminder** is a simple yet effective plugin for Elgato Stream Deck that helps users stay hydrated by reminding them to drink water at regular intervals. The plugin features a customizable timer that allows users to set reminder intervals, represented visually by a glass of water that empties over time. When it's time to drink water, a sound plays and the glass resets once the user acknowledges the reminder.

## Features
- **Custom Reminder Intervals**: Set the time between reminders to drink water using a customizable slider (from 5 to 120 minutes).
- **Visual Indicator**: A glass of water icon slowly empties as the reminder interval progresses, keeping users visually informed.
- **Sound Notification**: Plays a water drop sound when it's time to drink.
- **Responsive Interaction**: Reset the reminder by pressing the Stream Deck key, which refills the glass of water.

## Installation
- **Download the Plugin**: Download and install through the El Gato Marketplace.

## Usage

### Setting Reminder Intervals:
1. Right-click on the button where you placed the Water Reminder action.
2. Go to **Settings** and adjust the slider to set the time interval (from 5 to 120 minutes).
3. The glass of water will gradually empty over the set time.

### Acknowledge Reminder:
1. When the time interval is up, a short sound will play, and the glass will have an exclamation mark to remind you to drink water.
2. Press your Stream Deck button to refill the glass and restart the timer.

## Customization
- **Reminder Interval**: Use the slider to set the reminder interval (default is 60 minutes).

## Troubleshooting
- **No Sound**: Ensure that your computer's sound is on and that the correct audio output device is selected.
- **Visual Errors**: If the glass of water isn't updating, make sure the Stream Deck software is updated to the latest version and try restarting the app.
